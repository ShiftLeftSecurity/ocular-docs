# CPG2SP

CPG2SP is a [ShiftLeft Command Line Tool](index.html) for generating *security profiles*.

CPG2SP translates code property graphs into security profiles (SP) according to a security policy. To this end, CPG2SP performs static data-flow analysis to determine flows in the application that violate policy rules.

For the code property graph "cpg.bin.zip", a corresponding security profile can be generated using CPG2SP as follows:

```bash
cpg2sp --cpg cpg.bin.zip -o sp
```

By default the *security profile* is represented in a Protobuf-based binary format. To gain greater visibility into the content of a security profile without additional tooling, the SP can also be generated in human-readable  JSON format using the following command:
 
```bash
cpg2sp --cpg cpg.bin.zip -o sp.json --json
```

Refer to other areas of the command line tools documentation to analyze and process code property graphs and security profiles as generated by java2cpg and cpg2sp, including:

* [REPL](repl.html)
* [Policy Language](policy-language.html)
